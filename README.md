I altered the api a little. I added users and formed a relationship betwwen users and todos.

You can:

-- Creatte a new user
-- Delete a user and all it's todos
-- Change your user name
-- Change between light and dark modes in the To Do Screen (not in user creation screen. It always will be on light mode.)
-- Create a new to do
-- Edit the content of your to do
-- Mark any to do as complete or incomplete
-- Delete any to do
-- Delete all completed todos
