I altered the api a little. I added users and formed a relationship betwwen users and todos.

You can:

-- Create a new user <br />
-- Delete a user and all its todos <br />
-- Change your user name <br />
-- Change between light and dark modes in the To Do Screen (not in user creation screen. It always will be on light mode.) <br />
-- Create a new to do <br />
-- Edit the content of your to do <br />
-- Mark any to do as complete or incomplete <br />
-- Delete any to do <br />
-- Delete all completed todos <br />

How to run:

First run :
### `npm install`

Then run:
### `npm start`
